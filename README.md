# MemShareGameOfLife
Model of Conway's Game of Life done in Go. Game Of Life is a simulation for cells. The main purpose of this project is to explore different styles of concurrency and discovering which one is the most efficient.

This version of the program implements GameOfLife through memory sharing, a more optimal way than the CSP-style approach from the other GameOfLife project.
